# Advent of Code 2023

These are the solution for my Advent of Code 2023! 🎄

Language: Python 🐍

## How to run problems

To run a specific problem, use the following command:

```
    python run.py day part -t testname
```

-   Day: What day in the advent of code
-   Part: Which part for the given day
-   -t: Optional parameter for what test to use. If not supplied, defaults to the given problem input.

The following example will run day 3 part 1 on test1.txt

```
    python run.py 3 1 -t test1
```
